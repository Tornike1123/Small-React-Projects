2. class-components - how works **class components**

###### Adventage of Function(Stateless) Components:

-   Simple functions
-   Use Func components as much as possible
-   Absence of 'this' keyword
-   Solution without using state
-   Mainly responsible for the UI
-   Stateless/ Dumb/ Presentational

###### Adventage of Class(Stateful) Components:

-   More feature rich
-   Maintain their own private data - state
-   Complex UI logic
-   Provide lifecycle hooks
-   Stateful/Smart/Container

###### PROPS VS STATE

**PROPS**

-   Props get passed to the component
-   Function parameters
-   Props are immutable
-   Props - Functional Components this.- Props - Class Components

**STATE**

-   State is managed within the component
-   Variables declared in the function body
-   State can be changed
-   useState Hook - Functional Components this.state - Class Components
